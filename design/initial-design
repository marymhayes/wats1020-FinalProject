Final Project Concept:
I am going to create a beautiful and clean single-page website for an actor friend of mine. She currently has no 
professional web presence and I want to make a central location for casting agents, directors, and other creatives 
to access images, video clips, CV, and bio. During my first quarter the I came across some websites that whose 
elements changed with scrolling. They made an impact on me and I’ve been wanting to try something like that so I 
plan on using ScrollReveal.js to make separation and visual interest between the categories. I’ll have a navigation 
bar at the top so that a user can jump directly to the content that they are interested in and currently I think that 
there will be five separate sections: Home, About/CV, Images, Video, and Contact Info. It’s important to me that the 
site looks clean and classic, but also beautiful, because many of the actor pages I have looked at while researching 
are pretty underwhelming. I don’t have an exact plan off Animate.css yet, but I think that it may be helpful in this 
instance and I would like to begin to get familiar with it for future projects. I would also like to use this as an 
opportunity to build more familiarity with Bootstrap and will be using it to make the site mobile accessible.
